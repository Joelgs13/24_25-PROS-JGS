//problem solving
//the principal issue I had was that, when I tried to pass the integer to the server, it doesnâ€™t work okay. The problem was that I was using on the server dataImputStream and DataOutputStream and in the client I was using bufferedwriter and bufferedreadre. So when in the client I was reading text, in the server I was recibing a binary value. The 2 of them need to use the same read/write protocol.
